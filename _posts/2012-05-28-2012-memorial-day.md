Once again we celebrate Memorial Day in the USA.
<img class="post-image" src="/files/2012-05-28-memorial-day.png" />

Today is Memorial Day in the USA.

It is a special day, dedicated to celebrate, remember and honor the veterans that have gone and fought for all the liberties that we all enjoy today (and in most cases take for granted).

I would like to personally say a **thank you** - which is not enough for sure - to all those that ensured and continue to do so, &nbsp;that my family, friends and I are safe and free.
