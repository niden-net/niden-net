I finally gave in and decided to become a bit serious with my blog. I have been trying to find time to update this website for years and finally decided I cannot procrastinate any more. 

So welcome to my new site. I have installed the latest and greatest Wordpress version and although I have never used this software, it seems pretty straightforward i.e. it works :) 

Feel free to browse around. So far I have moved all my past posts into this site, in an effort to keep what I had already written in case anyone ever wanted to look for those blog posts.

Thanks for visiting and as always I welcome your comments!
