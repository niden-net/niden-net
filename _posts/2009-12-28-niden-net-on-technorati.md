A good friend of mine suggested that I should add my blog to [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) for more exposure. Although I do not have any misconceptions as to whether my blog will reach the top 100 - I know it never will - it is nice to know that I am making every effort to bring people here and share my thoughts with them.

Discussion is always good and I welcome everyone's opinion especially when it differs from mine :) Hopefully people that read this blog will get something out of it.

So by registering (or claiming) my blog in [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) I need to add a unique code that was generated only for me in a blog post (drumroll please).... and the code is:

```html

```

This should do the trick. Once I click on the relevant button in my account page in Technorati, it should be able to verify that I am the owner of this blog and add my blog in the directory yay!
