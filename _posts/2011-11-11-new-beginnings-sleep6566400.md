It has been a very long time since I last blogged.

The primary reason is that I have been busy and somewhat lazy. Hopefully that trend (the laziness) will not last that much and I will be able to post in higher frequency.

The biggest update for me came this July. I was actively searching for a new employment opportunity for quite some time, but due to the current market situation, it has been a really difficult task.

In July I received (and accepted) an offer from [Avectra Inc.](https://www.avectra.com/) I am now a PHP developer for [MemberFuse&trade;](https://www.memberfuse.com/), a professional networking application that integrates with the client's association management software and builds an online community for that client.

My colleagues and I are programming in PHP using a frameworks such as [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/), [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com/), [Smarty](https://www.smarty.net/] and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) on the client side. The application we produce is offered as SAAS (Software As A Service) and we have well over 1 million users.

Although adjusting to the new environment was rough and the learning curve was steep (it didn't help that one colleague decided to resign and I inherited his workload from week 2), I managed to *survive* and I am more and more confident every day.

I can only say that working with smart people that push you to excel is a blessing!

The second update is this blog's location. With the introduction of the new dynamic templates in Blogger, I decided to move from Wordpress (and my personal installation for my blog) to Blogger.

The downside was that Blogger could not import my blog. I would always get errors when trying to upload the XML file and after a few tries I decided to go the manual way. I therefore sat down and copied and pasted all the content that I had posted in the past to the new platform.

Luckily it was not a very difficult task, but it was time consuming. Last night I managed to finish everything and write this blog post.

With this move unfortunately I lost all the comments on my posts and I am sure that there will be some broken links here and there but in the end it will all work out.

It was my intention to post this message today (11-11-11) at 11:11 but I kinda messed up the scheduling so the post is being posted a few hours later.

I hope you will enjoy my posts.
