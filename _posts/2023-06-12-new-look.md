It has been a while since I posted. Lately I am using this blog as a storage of things I find, potentially interesting to others but as a reminder for myself, for things I have done in the past.

Since I am not a UI/UX designer, I opted to purchase a theme from the Internet. The theme is called [Color Admin](https://seantheme.com/) and I really liked it, especially the dark mode (this is why I enabled it on my blog).

After checking out the samples available, adjusting them to my Jekyll templates, I think I managed to cover all the areas that I had initially. Sadly the theme I was using before is no longer maintained, therefore something new was needed.

I took the time also to reorganize the tags page, put a new sidebar with the most recent posts and a new archive page.

I hope you like the new look.
