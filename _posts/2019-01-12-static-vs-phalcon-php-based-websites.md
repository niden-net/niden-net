Developing in Phalcon for over 5 years, I have grown accustomed to solve my problems by just using Phalcon for my web applications. It is fast, it is rich in features and I am extremely comfortable with it.

Recently I have discovered a new "breed" of websites. Static ones.

The idea is that the site gets "compiled" and HTML files are being created, and the site gets published. This way when a visitor comes to the site, there is pretty much no processing using an engine such as PHP or others.
