Today, the Memorial Day is celebrated across the USA. There are similar celebrations in Greece, not the same day as in the US but remembering and honoring the veterans for their sacrifices for the freedoms we and our families enjoy.

I received an email this morning which I thought was too precious to be archived in my mail folders. Since I hate mass mailing and chain emails, I thought I would duplicate the email here for my archiving but also for everyone else to see.

Please note that I am not the original author of the email and I do not know if it has appeared as a blog post or an article someplace. I do not own the images presented below either so if there is a copyright issue, please let me know and I will remove them immediately. If you know who the original author is, please let me know so that I can give them the mention they deserve.

No matter what the country of your origin, there are always some people that step up in difficult situations. Those men and women gladly give their lives for the better good, so that others can enjoy a better future. Those people are the Veterans that we must always remember and honor.
