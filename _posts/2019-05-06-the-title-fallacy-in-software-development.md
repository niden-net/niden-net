Junior developer, Senior developer, Senior Architect... So many titles floating around when looking for a job in Software Development or when looking at the company you work for.

But should we be talking about titles, experience or knowledge? What gauges salary compensation?

It is a common mistake that companies make, that equate title with experience and thus salary. There have been some trends lately from Software companies to reward mostly experience than titles but this trend is not moving fast enough.

Scenario 1: You have a guy that started his job as a Junior Software Developer. He was moved to technical support with little access to code and stayed there. For whatever reason, he was happy where he was. Time passed, he got a raise every year and fast forward 10 years later he is making 100K and has the title of Intermediate Software Developer.

When he decides to move to another job, should the new employer start the salary from the 100K (which could very well be a Senior's salary) or from the Intermediate? Or should this be an experience/knowledge starting point which would dictate that the company should start the salary from the Junior level. After all, our hypothetical employee never really learned anything in terms of Software development. He was just working on tech support. He might have tons of experience supporting an application or two, but never really delved into the code and expanded his horizons.
