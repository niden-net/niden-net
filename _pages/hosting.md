Throughout the years, I needed hosting for my personal websites or those of my clients. I have utilized the services of big players such as Amazon, Linode, DigitalOcean etc. but there has always been something that they were lacking, or they ended up being too expensive.

The last few years, I have distanced myself from the plain vanilla model, which is _use WordPress for a simple website_.

WordPress is a great platform, and although the core installation is fairly secure, the addons that people use, are not so much. As such, hackers will be able to find a back door through a plugin that has a defect (that they know of or not) and destroy a site's content.

Because of the above, I have moved my efforts to create static websites and offer them to my customers. A static website cannot be hacked, and it is much faster than any other website that uses a web language.

Static sites can be easily updated by the owner, using a simple interface, and once updated, they are pre-built, uploaded and the changes propagated to the live site. The static generator I prefer using is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you are interested in building a simple website for your company, to have a presence on the Internet, or converting your existing site to a static one, feel free to contact me. I would be more than happy to discuss your project needs and come up with a plan that suits you best. Setup for the most part will be free, and the per-month hosting is extremely reasonable.

Please note though, I am not a UI designer. As such, any solution for your website would have to come from pre-made templates by others. I can only do the programming and set up parts, the content will be all yours.
