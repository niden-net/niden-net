Welcome to my website development services, where I cater to your personal and business needs. Whether you are looking to establish a new online presence or enhance an existing one, I am here to assist you.

Key Features:

### Static Websites for Security and Speed:
All the websites that I create for customers are static, ensuring heightened security against hacking and distortion. Additionally, static sites boast faster loading times, providing an optimal user experience.

### Powered by Jekyll:
I employ Jekyll, a static website generator, to create websites efficiently. This process involves parsing the main components of the site and relevant programming. The output is then uploaded to the hosting company, making your website live.

### Version Control with Git:
Your website's code is stored in a Git repository, guaranteeing a comprehensive record of any changes made throughout its life cycle.

### Tailored Solutions:
While I specialize in programming and setup, please note that I am not a UI designers. The visual elements of your website will be derived from pre-made templates, allowing you to retain full control over your content.

### Dynamic Content Options:

### Consultation and Setup:
I offer complimentary consultations to discuss your needs and determine the best solution for you. The initial setup is also part of my service, ensuring a seamless experience for you.
