If you are in need of a website for your personal or business needs, I can now offer my services to help you fulfill this need.

Whether you have an existing site or thinking of a new one, I would be happy to have a discussion with you, to figure out what is best for you.

The websites that I create and host, are all static. This means that your website can never be hacked or deformed, and additionally it is going to be very fast.

I am utilizing a static website generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which generates a website by parsing the main components of the site (and relevant programming). The output is then uploaded to the hosting company and becomes live.

All the code for the website is stored in a Git repository, ensuring that there is a record of any changes made to the site throughout its life.

Please note though, I am not a UI designer. As such, any solution for your website would have to come from pre-made templates by others. I can only do the programming and set up parts, the content will be all yours.

The websites that I create can have content that rarely changes or are dynamic, with content that changes frequently, such as a blog, newsletter updates etc.

For the most part, the discussion and the setup are going to be free, and the monthly hosting is extremely reasonable.

I would be happy to have a chat with you to figure out your needs and see if I can help.
