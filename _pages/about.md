Welcome to **niden.net**.

Greetings! I'm Nikolaos Dimopoulos, also known as Nikos. With over two decades of experience in the IT industry, I've dedicated 15 years to the analysis and design of applications. Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with numerous clients on projects of varying scales, all of which have been both challenging and immensely interesting.

### Areas of Expertise:
My expertise spans a wide range, including PHP, MySQL, MSSQL, AJAX, distributed programming, and three-tier architectures. Since 2002, I've been a Zend Certified Engineer, assisting clients with their PHP requirements. Presently, my focus lies on security and Object-Oriented Programming, adopting a Test Driven Development approach.

### Educational Initiatives:
In addition to my technical work, I'm passionate about educating others on the advantages of Open Source applications and the benefits of transitioning to Internet/Cloud-based solutions over the traditional server/desktop approach.

### Contributions:
As a core member of [Phalcon](https://phalcon.io), I contribute to a PHP framework delivered as a C extension and written in [Zephir](https://zephir-lang.com). This involvement allows me to stay at the forefront of innovative developments in the field.

### Certifications:
I am proud to be both a [Zend Certified Engineer](https://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND006669) and a [Professional Scrum Developer](https://www.scrum.org/user/504482).

Thank you for visiting **niden.net**! If you have any inquiries or if there's anything I can assist you with, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Nikolaos Dimopoulos
