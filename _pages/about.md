Welcome to **niden.net**.

Hello! My name is Nikolaos (or Nikos) Dimopoulos. I have been in the IT business for more than 20 years, 15 of which have been dedicated to analysis and design of applications. Throughout my career I have had the pleasure of working with numerous clients. The projects that I undertook ranged from large to small and the vast majority were very challenging and interesting at the same time!

My expertise includes but is not limited to PHP, MySQL, MSSQL, AJAX, distributed programming and three tier architectures. I am a Zend Certified Engineer and have been helping customers since 2002 with their PHP needs. Nowadays I am focusing on security, Object Oriented Programming with a Test Driven Development approach.

I am also working in educating anyone who wants to listen :) on the benefits of Open Source applications and the benefits of using the Internet/Cloud versus the traditional server/desktop approach.

I am a core member of [Phalcon](https://phalconphp.com), a PHP framework delivered as a C extension and written in [Zephir](https://zephir-lang.com).

I am a [Zend Certified Engineer](https://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND006669) and a [Professional Scrum Developer](https://www.scrum.org/user/504482).

Thanks for visiting. Should you have any queries, feel free to contact me.
